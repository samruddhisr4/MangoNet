# MangoNet: VGG16-Based Deep Learning for Mango Classification

## Overview

**MangoNet** is a deep learning project that leverages transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture to classify mango varieties from images. The system is designed for practical deployment in agriculture, fruit markets, and processing facilities, enabling automated, accurate, and scalable mango sorting and grading.

## Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained VGG16 for efficient feature extraction and classification.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Supports identification of 8 mango varieties.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies real-time augmentation to improve model robustness and prevent overfitting.
- **Web Application**: Includes a Flask-based web interface for easy image upload and prediction.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves over 96% accuracy on the test set.
